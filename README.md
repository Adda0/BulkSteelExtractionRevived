# Bulk Steel Extraction Revived
Repository for Bulk Steel Extraction Revived mod for [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com).

## Credits
The code for mod's settings in RimWorld's Mod Options was based on the code of [SF More Steel from Slag](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1558034969). I used the code and edited it for usage purposes of this mod.

Original mod idea and the base of the mod itself is coming from [Bulk Steel Extraction](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1245543428). I just updated this mod for RimWorld 1.1.
